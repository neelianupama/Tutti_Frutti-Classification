# Tutti Frutti - Classification of 60 Fruit Types

## Overview

**Tutti Frutti** is a machine learning project designed to classify images of 60 different types of fruits. This project utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to recognize and classify fruit images with high accuracy. It provides a simple web interface for users to upload fruit images and get real-time classification results.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classify images into 60 different fruit categories.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly web interface for uploading fruit images.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Instant classification results displayed on the web page.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for backend and model implementation.
- **Flask**: Web framework used to create the web application.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning library used for the model.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend technologies used to create the user interface.
